# State of the Art

## STUDY OF THE DOMAIN

The project focuses on a specific sub-phenomenon within Cancel Culture, which is the removal of statues portraying historical figures who have been criticized as responsible for ideas or actions deemed morally and socially unjust.

In order to better define the domain, we carefully reviewed both literature related to Cancel Culture as a wider form of activism and specific case studies which involved controversial monuments.

The following paragraphs summarize our research and present a glossary of the most recurrent terms in the definition of the phenomena at hand.

## STATE OF THE ART

Starting from the broader phenomenon, we collected both scholarly papers and journal articles devoted to Cancel Culture in general. The references listed in the Bibliography and Sitography sections tackle the topic from different perspectives and backgrounds (legal, historical, social), but overall, though having a different focus on this complex matter, these studies agreed on some characteristics of Cancel Culture, in particular:

* CC is not a movement, but rather a form of activism which has its origins in the digital era. Itâ€™s rooted in the Internet and social media platforms
* Its target, which may or may not be human (including, for example, public spaces and monuments, works of art or brands) is condemned as bearer of ideas or attitudes which are socially or morally inacceptable in the eyes of the activists
* It aims at the removal of its target from the public sphere or memory

\
As for the particular expression of CC that is statue removal, we both reviewed literature we could find about the topic and searched for debates and protests surrounding controversial monuments, which could help us better understand and describe the phenomenon. The Contested Histories Initiative, a co-initiative of the European Association of History Educators (EuroClio) and the Institute for Historical Justice and Reconciliation (IHJR) was particularly useful in this sense. Contested Histories maintains a set of digital resources dedicated to debates related to examples of divisive historical memory, in order to foster a deeper comprehension of the phenomenon and was our main reference both for case studies review and for defining a classification that we later used in our conceptual model.
